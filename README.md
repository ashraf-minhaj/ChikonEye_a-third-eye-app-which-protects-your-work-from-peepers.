# Older version documentation
To do face recognition one has to run 3 different codes DataSet creator then Train the model then Recognizer code. I have written a single python script that will do all those 3 jobs by itself. SO you don't need to worry a bit. 

Additional features like GUI and Auto Lock Screen have been added.
Version: 2.0 (all codes in one .py file).
Update: 7th April 2019
No need to input parent folder path. The code finds the parent path
by itself.

Contains: 1. Dataset Creator (take photo and create a dataset)
          2. Tariner    (training your model)
          3. Recognizer (the code that recognizes you)
          4. Amazingly with GUI support (makes this code more user friendly)

A program that watches your back while working on your pc and locks the screen if it sees some1 unauthorized watching at your work- thus protects your valuable work or sometimes saves the personality.

ChikonEye uses your laptops primary or secondary camera to see how 
many people are watching at the computer screen. If some1 unauthorized tries to see 
it automatically locks the computer screen.

Completely in testing period.
I'll make and executable .exe file so that this can be run on any computer.
right now it can be used by the people who has python, numpy, opencv, pyautogui and pillow
installed in their pc. Don't worry exe is coming soon.
