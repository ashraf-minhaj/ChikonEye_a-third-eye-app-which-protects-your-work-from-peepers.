A program that watches your back while working on your pc and locks the screen if it sees some1 unauthorized watching at your work- thus protects your valuable work or sometimes saves the personality.

ChikonEye uses your laptops primary or secondary camera to see how 
many people are watching at the computer screen. If some1 unauthorized tries to see 
it automatically locks the computer screen.

Completely in testing period.
I'll make and executable .exe file so that this can be run on any computer.
right now it can be used by the people who has python, numpy, opencv pyautogui
installed in their pc. Don't worry exe is coming soon.
